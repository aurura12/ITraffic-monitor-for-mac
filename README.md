## Want more than a live speed meter?

**[Try Bytetally Free](https://bytetally.app/)** — the modern, separately developed commercial edition from the same developer.

Bytetally Free goes far beyond iTraffic's real-time list. It adds a native dashboard, month-to-date usage, a 7-day device trend, monthly top apps, live charts, app drill-down, and accurate attribution through VPNs and local proxies. Pro goes one dimension further and shows the websites and services behind the traffic. Core monitoring is free forever, with no account, and your network-usage data stays on your Mac.
